					 A valid passport is typically required for international travel. Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your planned departure date. Some countries may have additional passport validity requirements, so check the entry requirements for your specific destination.<br><br>
					 The visa requirements vary depending on your nationality and the country you plan to visit. Some countries have visa-exempt agreements with certain nations, allowing travelers to enter without a visa for a limited period (e.g., tourist visa waivers). For other countries, you may need to apply for a visa in advance through an embassy or consulate.<br><br>
					 Many countries have agreements allowing citizens of certain countries to enter for tourism or business purposes without a visa for a specific duration. The length of stay permitted may vary from a few days to several months. However, even for visa-exempt travel, there might be restrictions on activities or limitations on the duration of stay. It's important to research the specific requirements and conditions for your nationality.<br><br>
					 Some countries offer visa-on-arrival services, which means you can obtain a visa upon arrival at the airport or border crossing. However, not all nationalities are eligible for this service, and there may be specific requirements or fees associated with it. Check the visa requirements for your destination to determine if this option is available to you.

					Airlines offer transit hotel accommodation to their passengers.<br><br>
					Airports have on-site or nearby hotels that are specifically designed for transit passengers. These hotels are usually located within the airport terminal or in close proximity, allowing travelers to easily access them without having to leave the airport premises. They offer comfortable rooms, convenient amenities, and services tailored to meet the needs of transit passengers, such as 24-hour check-in/check-out, shuttle services to the airport, and sometimes even access to airport lounges.<br><br>
					For instance, imagine a traveler has a long layover at an international airport. Instead of spending hours in uncomfortable seating areas, they can book a room at an airport hotel. These hotels often offer different types of rooms, ranging from standard rooms to luxury suites, to accommodate various budgets and preferences. The rooms are typically soundproofed to minimize noise from the airport, equipped with comfortable beds, private bathrooms, and amenities like Wi-Fi, TV, and work desks.<br><br>
					Additionally, airport hotels often have restaurants or dining options on-site, so travelers can enjoy a meal without having to venture far. Some hotels may also have fitness centers, swimming pools, or spa facilities for guests to relax and unwind during their stay. With 24-hour services, transit passengers can check-in and check-out at any time, allowing them to rest and freshen up before their next flight.
