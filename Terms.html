The offer may include details such as flight destinations, schedules, and fares.<br><br>

			The passenger accepts the airline's offer by purchasing a ticket, either online or through a ticketing agent. This acceptance creates a contractual agreement between the passenger and the airline.<br><br>

			In exchange for the transportation services, the passenger pays the airline the agreed-upon fare. This financial consideration is an essential element of the contract.<br><br>

			Airlines typically have a set of terms and conditions that govern the contractual relationship between the passenger and the airline. These terms and conditions may be provided to the passenger at the time of booking or made available on the airline's website. <br><br>

		<p>Ticket Reservation,To book a flight, you typically need to make a reservation by providing your travel details, including departure and arrival cities, travel dates, and the number of passengers. This can usually be done through the airline's website, mobile app, or by contacting their customer service.<br>

        Airlines offer different ticket types, such as economy, premium economy, business class, and first class. Each ticket type has its own set of rules, including baggage allowances, refundability, change flexibility, and in-flight services. Higher classes often come with additional benefits and amenities.<br>

		Booking has Fare Conditions. Fares can have specific conditions attached to them. These conditions may include minimum stay requirements, maximum stay limitations, advance purchase requirements, and specific travel dates or blackout periods. It's important to review the fare conditions before booking to understand any restrictions.<br>

		Airlines use dynamic pricing, where ticket prices can vary based on factors such as demand, availability, and time of booking. Prices tend to increase closer to the departure date, so booking in advance can often result in lower fares.<br>

		It has Ticket Payment. When booking a flight, you'll need to provide payment information. Airlines accept various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and sometimes alternative options like PayPal. Some airlines may offer installment plans or payment options like "buy now, pay later."<br>

		Airline has baggage Allowance.Airlines typically have specific baggage policies regarding the size, weight, and number of bags allowed. These rules can vary depending on the airline, ticket type, and destination. Exceeding the baggage limits may result in additional fees or the need to check excess baggage.<br><br></p>

			Refundable tickets are generally more expensive than non-refundable ones, but they offer the flexibility to cancel your flight and receive a full refund, or sometimes a partial refund, depending on the airline's policy.<br>

			Change and cancellation fees. Many airlines charge change or cancellation fees, especially for non-refundable tickets. These fees can change.<br><br></p>
